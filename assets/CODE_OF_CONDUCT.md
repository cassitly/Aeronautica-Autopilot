# Citizen Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

The main goal of the Aeronautica Autopilot Community is to be welcoming to as many people as possible, no matter their background. We’re all about creating a safe, friendly, and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or religion (or none at all).

This code of conduct outlines what we expect from everyone involved in our community and what happens if those expectations aren't met.

We encourage everyone in the Aeronautica Autopilot Community to help us keep things positive and safe for all.

## 2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship

A key part of this Code of Conduct is to promote positive open [source/culture/tech] participation by encouraging us all to consider how our actions impact the community. Our community is like society itself, so it’s important to take action to counteract inequality and abuse of power.

If you see someone going out of their way to help make our community friendly and inclusive, let us know!

## 3. Expected Behavior

Here’s what we expect from everyone in the community:

 * Get involved in a genuine and active way. This helps the community grow and thrive.
 * Be respectful in your words and actions.
 * Work together before jumping into conflict.
 * No demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior.
 * Be aware of your surroundings and fellow participants. If you spot a dangerous situation or someone in distress, let the community leaders know.
 * Remember, community events might be in shared spaces, so always be respectful to everyone around you.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

We don’t tolerate any of the following behaviors in the Aeronautica Autopilot Community:

 * Violence, threats, or violent language.
 * Discriminatory jokes or language (sexist, racist, homophobic, etc.).
 * Posting explicit or violent content.
 * Doxing (posting someone’s personal info without consent).
 * Personal insults based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, etc.
 * Inappropriate photography or recording.
 * Unwelcome physical contact. Always get consent before touching someone.
 * Unwelcome sexual attention, including inappropriate comments or physical advances.
 * Stalking or intimidation, whether online or in person.
 * Encouraging or advocating for any of the above behavior.
 * Disrupting community events or talks.

## 5. Weapons Policy

No weapons are allowed at any Aeronautica Autopilot Community events or spaces, including things like guns, explosives, or large knives. If you’re found with one of these, you’ll be asked to leave and won’t be allowed back in until the item is removed. Please follow all local laws regarding weapons.

## 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

If anyone violates these rules, including sponsors and community leaders, they will be addressed immediately. 

Anyone who’s asked to stop inappropriate behavior must comply right away. We take these matters seriously, and anyone engaging in unacceptable behavior could face consequences like a temporary ban or permanent removal from the community.

## 7. Reporting Guidelines

If you see or experience unacceptable behavior, or if you have any concerns, please reach out to a community organizer (like me, @Cassitly). 

We’re also available to help if you need to contact local law enforcement or if you just need support. For in-person events, organizers can provide escorts if you’re feeling unsafe.

## 8. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you’ve been unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, please let me know (@Cassitly) with a clear description of the situation. We’ll handle your grievance following our existing policies.

## 9. Scope

We expect everyone involved in the community (contributors, sponsors, guests, etc.) to follow this Code of Conduct in all online and in-person spaces related to the community. This applies to one-on-one communication about community matters as well. 

If any unacceptable behavior happens outside community activities but could affect the safety of community members, we’ll address it.
